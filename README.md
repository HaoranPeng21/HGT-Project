This repository contains script for the HGT project.

The HGT_pipeline.R include analysis as following:

- **1. HGT information**: Basic identity/ length/ Rates/ Number/ Filteration compare.
- **2. Transfer pattern**: Transfer between Family/Genus/Species & ARGs Transfer pattern.
- **3. HGT function enrichment**: Perform enrichment analysis for genes enriched in HGT region.
- **4 HGT network & Trait Association**: Construct HGT network, Heatmap for Traits, Association between Traits & Network.
- **5 HGT rates & Species Correlation & Species phylogenetic distance**: Plotting histogram & Association
- **6 Microbial Community Guild**: Defining Communities, Heatmap for ARGs/AMPR/VFs, Statistical tests.
- **7 Mobile Elements transmission**: HGT presence/absence, Prevalence calculation, gene cluster detection, Phylogenetic tree for A. rectalis.
- **8 ME presence/ absence | delta Association**: Association between HGT & Phenotypes.
